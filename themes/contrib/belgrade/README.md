## INTRODUCTION

Belgrade is a Bootstrap sub-theme made for Drupal Commerce 2.0.

The Belgrade theme was designed and built around functionality provided by the Commerce Demo module. As a result, it has styling that targets specific components that the theme itself is unable to provide.

- An entity view mode for Commerce Product with the machine name `catalog`.
- Belgrade provides styling for a menu with the machine name `catalog`.
- A product catalog built with Views and the machine name `product_catalog`, using the `catalog` view mode for products.
- An image field on Commerce Product Variation bundles with the machine name `field_images`
